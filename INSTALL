INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR pyvlfeat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have tested this on Debian Linux and Mac OS X systems, please let me know 
if you have success on other platforms so I can list them as supported.

-- Building the Module on a Unix System --

The C++ wrappers require Boost.Python to be installed:

  $ sudo apt-get install boost-python-dev

pyvlfeat uses distutils, so to build the library:

  $ python setup.py build
